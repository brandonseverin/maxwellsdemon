# Maxwell's Demon

Outreach project I am working on for the Natalia Ares Group in the University of Oxford. 

First time playing with javascript, hopefully the game won't be too buggy :wink:.

I got my feet wet by following [Chris DeLeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoWqdEACyLI) and [Chris Courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6OkltgudE&list=PLpPnRKq7eNW3We9VdCfx9fprhqXHwTPXL) HTML5 Canvas animation tutorials on youtube. In fact, the majority of the foundational code for this project (balls on a canvas) was from [Chris Courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6OkltgudE&list=PLpPnRKq7eNW3We9VdCfx9fprhqXHwTPXL). Many thanks to [Ben Greenberg](https://github.com/nebbles/) with the tip on collision detection - he has some really cool javascript work [here](https://github.com/nebbles/js-sandbox).
