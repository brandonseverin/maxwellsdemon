# Maxwell's Game

An outreach project I am working on for the Natalia Ares Group in the University of Oxford. This is my first time playing with javascript, hopefully the game won't be too buggy :wink:.

## Quickstart Guide

- Use the  `space bar` on your keyboard to open the central trapdoor
- Try to collect the (red) hot fast-moving particles on one side of the divide and the (blue) cold slow-moving particles on the other.
- Can you create order from disorder? Click [here](https://brandonseverin.github.io/maxwellsdemon/) to start playing.

## FAQs

- *The `space bar` on my keyboard does not work. Can I still play the game?*

  Yes you can! You can use the `X` or the `O` key to open and close the trapdoor.
  
- *I resized my window, did I break the game?*

  The Demon in Maxwell's thought experiment was not allowed to change the size of the box. If you resize your window you must refresh the page and start the game again.

## Acknowledgements 

I got my feet wet by following [Chris DeLeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoWqdEACyLI) and [Chris Courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6OkltgudE&list=PLpPnRKq7eNW3We9VdCfx9fprhqXHwTPXL) HTML5 Canvas animation tutorials on youtube. In fact, the majority of the foundational education and code for this project (balls on a canvas with basic collision detection)  was from [Chris Courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6OkltgudE&list=PLpPnRKq7eNW3We9VdCfx9fprhqXHwTPXL) and [Spicy Yoghurt](https://spicyyoghurt.com/tutorials/html5-javascript-game-development/collision-detection-physics). Many thanks to [Ben Greenberg](https://github.com/nebbles/) with the tip on collision detection - he has some really cool javascript work [here](https://github.com/nebbles/js-sandbox). I really liked the way [Ben Greenberg](https://github.com/nebbles/) designed the info box for each programme so I adapted his CSS script to fit the game webpage.
